# DESI Tools

Some tools and notebooks for demonstrating how to download spectra from the [DESI Early Data Release](https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/releases/edr/) (EDR). The notebooks include examples of how to download spectra both directly from [DESI data archive](https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/access/), and using the NOIRlab's [SPARCL python client](https://astrosparcl.datalab.noirlab.edu/). 
The SPARCL client is the quickest way to access co-added spectra for single objects, but if you want all of the single-epoch spectra for an object, you must get them from the DESI archive.
